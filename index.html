            <h3>Summary</h3>
          <div class="col-sm">
          <p>This case study was done on a design project I completed in collaboration with two cohorts during my UX/UI Bootcamp intended to advocate for equal pay. The project focused on a new feature that aligns with Indeed’s current brand positioning, and it was added to an existing website as a standalone service. The scope of this project includes user research, product ideation, mid-fidelity prototyping via Figma, and high-fidelity prototyping via GitHub using HTML and CSS as the main programming languages. 
          </p>
          </div>
            <h3>Objective</h3>
          <div class="col-sm">
            <p>The objective of this project was to create a trustworthy platform for job seekers to gain negotiation skills through one-on-one training sessions with professional negotiation coaches who have previously walked through a similar career path.</p>

          <p class="card-text">We conducted a prilimiary survey to gauge whether they believe they have been underpaid and actions taken to solve such painpoint. We then conducted detailed interviews to reveal the tools our target audience's have used to prepare for a salary negotiation, as well as to measure the willingness to use a paid service. </p>

          <p class="card-text">Through empathy mapping and user journey simulation, we discovered that our target audience, the fair salary seekers, need more than just generic tips and suggestions and would like a more personalized step by step training even if it is a paid service. So we decided to create a professional salary coaching service for our target audience on behalf of Indeed. </p>

          <p class="card-text">We then created a mid-fidelity prototype(both mobile and web) in Figma, following Indeed's existing style guide. We also referenced the design conventions of some of Indeed's competitors such as Turbotax, Talkspace and Glassdoor. They offer great examples of step-by-step onboarding process. We also incorporated magenta color to increase the visibility of buttons against Indeed's signature blue.

          <p class="card-text">We recruited 3 volunteers and asked each of them to test 3 functions in the first round of usability testing. In this phase, we tested whether the purpose of the salary coaching service is clear, whether the review section is easy to find, and whether it is intuitive to navigate the steps of scheduling a session with a coach.

          <p class="lead" id="problem-statement-copy">According to the Harvard Business Review, “women are more reticent than men to negotiate their salary offers” and “the social cost of negotiating for pay is not significant for men, while it is significant for women.” The root cause of salary inequality is multifactorial. Our user research findings show that lack of confidence to utilize available data and the uncertainty in how best to advocate for salary increases remain two top pain points amongst our target audience.  </p>

However, a tester pointed out a point of confusion where the female coach selection does not match the male image on the confirmation page. We then updated the confirmation page by adding a blue overlay on the hero image to indicate that the confirmation page is generic. Not only does the new design reduce confusion, it also keeps the style cohesive with the the homepage. Per the feedback from our first round of usability testing, we also added the price of the service within the "Learn More" section of the new feature since that’s where users' eyes land on before continuing the survey process. We kept the reviews at the bottom but upgraded the display to a carosel to auto play those reviews to ease the users' effort of clicking through. </p>

      <h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
      <p>The salary coaching service we designed on behalf of Indeed.com can connect an equal-pay-seeker and a certified coach who is experienced and knowledgeable in their field of interest to share industry-specific insights. Through practicing real time with a human and receiving feedback, the equal-pay-seeker can have a clearer expectation on how much to ask for and more importantly, when and how to ask.</p>

      <h2 id="conclusion-and-future-opportunities">Conclusion and Future Opportunities</h2>
      <p>To add a finishing touch to our final deliverable, we would like to conclude this 2 week journey with a valuable takeaway: narrowing down the project scope is just as important as having a brilliant idea! </p>

      <p>We initially wanted to address the gender pay gap issue, however, the data we gathered in the survey were not clear-cut enough to indicate that “women are paid less than men due to the gender factor alone”. In reality, the issue is far more complex and the solutions aren’t black and white. It is also more difficult to measure success on a social issue compared to a for-profit opportunity. After some back and forth, we eventually decided to expand the audience to anyone who is actively seeking out a higher salary but lack the negotiation skills to do so rather than only helping women. </p>

      <p>Additionally, given the time constraint of this project, we struggled to gather enough data from the web analytic tools. However, as our site traffic builds up, we could easily harvest more compelling reports to help us make data-driven design iterations in the future.</p>
